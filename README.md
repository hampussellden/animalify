# animalify
A short Typescript project. Mix and match you own new animal!

## How it works
You will need an OpenAI account with some balance to get the full experience. 
Download and set up this [express erver](https://github.com/hampussellden/server) that will act as out back end and where the AI magic will happen.
Update the ENV files to match your OpenAI account.
Open the server on one localhost and the program from this repository in another, and try creating your new favourite animal!
